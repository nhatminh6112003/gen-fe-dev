    'California Governor Gavin Newsom has vetoed a statewide bill that would have established a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency regulation—and crypto proponents are thrilled.In a Friday memo detailing the veto decision, Newsom called Assembly Bill 2269 “premature” and said a “more flexible approach” was essential for the state because he believes blockchain technology is still evolving. The veto came despite strong support in the state legislature, where the bill secured 71 “yes” votes, 0 “no” votes, and nine abstentions.If it had been signed into law, crypto firms would have been required to acquire a state-approved license to operate in California. In his veto message, Newsom also cited the substantial cost of implementing the bill, sharing that the passage of AB2269 would require a loan in “the tens of millions of dollars” for the state.Notably, Newsom also wants to wait until the federal government’s stance on crypto regulation is solidified and the results of his May Executive Order on cryptocurrency are presented. Earlier this year, Newsom signed Executive Order N-9-22 for his administration to research cryptocurrency and “establish a transparent regulatory environment” for it in California. “It is premature to lock a licensing structure in statute without considering both this work and forthcoming federal actions,” Newsom wrote in the memo.Newsom isn’t the only one who had concerns about AB 2269. The Chamber of Progress—a pro-crypto technology policy coalition with partners like Amazon, Apple, Circle, FTX US, and Meta—also took issue with aspects of the bill and requested multiple revisions back in June, which were incorporated into the final draft. Chamber of Progress then issued a new memo approving of the latest version of the bill, pending a few additional revisions. Specifically, it did not want California to ban algorithmic stablecoin licenses and requested clarification on which cryptocurrencies would fall under the purview of the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation. But Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich is actually pleased with Newsom’s veto decision.“This gives the California legislature a chance to take a less rushed, more inclusive approach to developing crypto regulations that protect consumers and allow for innovation,” Kovacevich said in a statement. “There’s a huge opportunity in the next few years for California and other states to get crypto regulation right.”Attorney Hailey Lennon was also pleased with Newsom’s decision, calling it “good news” for the crypto industry.Likewise, the crypto lobbying group the Blockchain Association was thrilled with the veto news, calling the bill “misguided.”“We applaud Gov Gavin Newsom’s veto of California Assembly Bill 2269, which threatened to choke innovation and stop California’s burgeoning crypto industry in its tracks,” the group wrote in a statement.The accolades continued to flow, as Jake Chervinsky, head of policy for Blockchain Association, said Newsom “deserves serious respect” for rejecting AB 2269.',
